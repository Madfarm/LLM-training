Abraham,Clearfield,Distinguished Professor,"Our research interests are focused in solid state and materials chemistry and encompass a wide variety of projects. An important goal is the ability to design and synthesize new materials whose structure and properties can be predicted and controlled. Layered compounds are amenable to manipulation to produce new structures because of the weak forces between layers. We have learned how to separate the layers of several classes of compounds and are reconstituting them into novel materials. For example, we have prepared staged materials in which alternating layers are hydrophobic and hydrophilic.<br /><br /><br /><br />The surfaces of our layered materials react with a variety of molecules to bond them to the surface. We are developing such materials for drug delivery, heterogeneous catalysis, and polymer-nanoparticle composites.<br /><br /><br /><br />Single crystal X-ray diffraction has been the key tool in elucidating the structure of solids. For many compounds, single crystals are unavailable so that indirect methods need to be used. We pioneered the solution of crystal structures from X-ray powder data and have had considerable success. The methods need to be improved and extended to more complex systems such as poorly crystallized materials. Combined use of X-ray, neutron and synchrotron methods are in progress and extension to EXAFS and amorphous scattering techniques is contemplated.",Distinguished Professor,Chemistry,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n6dc4bd81

His first book, Democracy and Rhetoric: John Dewey on the Arts of Becoming, uses Dewey's philosophy to construct a view of rhetoric, logic, and aesthetics that is consistent with an ethics of democracy that promotes creative individuality. His second book, Rhetoric and Power: The Drama of Classical Greece, explores through the texts of canonical authors like Aeschylus, Gorgias, Thucydides, and Plato how rhetoric was conceptualized as a means of constituting and transforming power in Greek political culture. His third book, The Keys of Power: The Rhetoric and Politics of Transcendentalism, interprets the writing and thought of figures like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Margaret Fuller as active rhetorical engagements with the political controversies of their time.

By improving our understanding of the complex dynamics of the water and nutrient cycles, we seek to develop quantitative tools that help us preserve soil ecosystem services, such as soil and plant carbon storage, and prevent our ecosystems from degrading.<br /><br /><br /><br />To tackle such fundamental questions on these rather complex biotic/abiotic interactions and shed light on their dominant dynamics, we borrow tools from fluid mechanics, dynamical system theory, stochastic processes and thermodynamics to use in conjunction with experimental observations.<br /><br /><br /><br />Specific research projects include modeling soil moisture dynamics and its control on biogeochemical cycle across climatic gradients, identification of long terms hydro-climatic drivers of chemical weathering, estimation of long term hydrologic and energy partitioning, quantification of soil formation processes, and modeling the effect of water management strategies.",Assistant Professor,Biological and Agricultural Engineering,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/n9705ab00

Jiang,Chang,Professor,"Heart failure (impaired ventricular pump function) is an eventual outcome for diverse cardiovascular disorders and the leading cause of combined morbidity and mortality in the United States and other developed industrial nations. The focus of my lab is to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms that initiate and mediate the pathogenesis of maladaptive cardiac remodeling, such as cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis as result of various pathological scenarios such as myocardial infarction, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, aging and post-traumatic stress disorder. The overall approach consists of generation and analysis of clinically-relevant genetic mouse models including a tool mouse enabling tracking endogenous cardiac exosomes, and conduct mechanistic studies using cutting-edge technology. The ultimate goal of our efforts is to provide clinical translation for the prevention and treatment of pathological cardiac remodeling from our mechanistic studies.",Professor,Center for Genomic and Precision Medicine,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nf80a9dad
J. Richard,Conner,Senior Professor,Dr. Conner's research emphasizes the integration of economics with ecology in the management of grazinglands and related resources. His work has dealt with such issues as how to select the optimal combination of wildlife/ livestock enterprises while considering both biological diversity and relative levels and variation in enterprise costs and prices. Much of his work has been directed toward the development of analytical methodologies which facilitate incorporating the impacts of variation inherent to range- related enterprises into management decisions. Dr. Conner also participates in an interdisciplinary team dedicated to the development of computerized decision support systems (DSS) for use by grazingland resource managers. The DSS are designed to assist resource managers in both strategic and tactical planning and provide a means of appropriately accounting for both economic and ecologic consequences of alternative management practices.,Senior Professor,Agricultural Economics,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nf83efa4d

Kevin,Conway,Associate Professor,"The central goal of the TAMU Systematic Ichthyology Laboratory is to document the taxonomic, anatomical, ontogenetic, and genetic diversity of teleost fishes. Teleost fishes are without-a-doubt the most successful group of fishes (and probably vertebrates) on the planet currently and have colonized almost all available aquatic habitats (and even some terrestrial habitats). The morphological diversity of teleosts is unparalleled by any other group of vertebrates, ranging in size from tiny 7mm long minnows to 10meter long oar fish, and in shape from ribbon-like eels to globe-like pufferfishes.  We investigate this diversity not only to further our understanding of vertebrate anatomy in general but also to discover novel characters to advance our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of select groups of teleost fishes. Our investigations frequently lead to the discovery of previously unrecognized taxonomic diversity and one of the broader aims of the TAMU Systematic Ichthyology Laboratory is to document this diversity through the description of new species.",Associate Professor,Ecology and Conservation Biology,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nfaafc469

Dae Seok,,Associate Professor,"My research agenda includes three interrelated strands: (a) expatriation effectiveness, (b) leadership in diverse cultural contexts, and (c) workforce development (Training, Organization Change) in an international context. <br /><br />My first research strand focuses on cultural adjustment and developmental needs of populations on the cultural border who have been doubly marginalized by culture, ethnicity, gender, social status, or a combination of these factors. For example, international students are consistently underrepresented and report great difficulty integrating both academically and socially. To help these doubly marginalized population, I have examined relationships among their cultural adjustment, engagement, antecedents, and outcomes in U.S. and Japanese universities. The findings guide administrators to make informed decisions and policies and strategically allocate resources and help faculty and staff better understand the unique challenges facing international students to directly advise and help them. <br /><br />My second research strand focuses on leadership in diverse cultural contexts. Despite the significance of culturally embedded leadership practices, most research has implemented extant leadership theories based on western cultural contexts without critically discussing implications for the local culture. I led a collaborative research team to conduct research on leadership effectiveness in Korea. Building on these findings, I also conducted a cross-cultural study (the U.K. and Korea) and a cross-sectional comparative study (public and private sector). <br /><br />My third research strand is workforce development in an international context.  I collaboratively developed an interdisciplinary team with faculty members in STEM fields. Although research has documented the need for cultural competence, it has not been a strong focus in undergraduate STEM education. To address these needs, we developed and submitted an NSF proposal to design a global exposure undergraduate course implementing innovative learning activities and assignments.  Through this course, STEM students will learn how other countries come up with innovative engineering solutions and how cultural characteristics play critical roles in understanding and solving engineering problems. This experience will also benefit students, faculty, employers, and industry partners by engaging key stakeholders in dialogue and training around skills for a global workforce. <br /><br />These collaborations have led to multiple refereed articles, book chapters, and conference proceedings. These works also led to invitations to share the findings and implications at institutions in the U.S., Korea, and Japan. My scholarship has also been recognized internationally with awards, the Outstanding Assistant Professor Award from the University Council of Workforce Human Resource Education, the Academy of Human Resource Development (AHRD) through its Early Career Scholar Award and Cutting Edge Awards.",Associate Professor,Educational Administration and Human Resource Development,https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nfbbb62f9
